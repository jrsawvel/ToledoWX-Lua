# ToledoWX-Lua

The bin directory will be based upon Lua, instead of Perl, which is what I used to create the original ToledoWX code, located at <https://github.com/jrsawvel/ToledoWX>. The original ToledoWX manages my site <http://toledoweather.info>.

The templating system used for this version relies on Lua's implementation of [Mustache](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/lustache).

The test site is located at <http://toledoweatherlua.soupmode.com>.
