# ToledoWX-Lua

The bin directory will be based upon Lua, instead of Perl, which is what I used to create the original ToledoWX code, located at <https://github.com/jrsawvel/ToledoWX>. The original ToledoWX manages my site <http://toledoweather.info>.

I may create a Toledo Weather site at a sub-domain that is based upon the Lua version.
